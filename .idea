Our web repo is currently messed up. Components & UI Components are not arranged as it should.
From now on the project structure should be similar to this:
src/
web-ui/
shared
feature_1
Input/
Input.js
Input.scss

feature_2
feature_3

app/
shared/
utils/
services
feature_1
shared
components
Form
Form.js
FormComponent.js
Form.scss
action
reducer
FeatureOne.js
feature_2
shared
components
action
reducer
FeatureTwo.js
feature_3

web-ui should only contain a class or stateless component without any function files, no redux, just pure react.
